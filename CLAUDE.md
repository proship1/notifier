## Project Status

This is a new, empty project directory. No existing codebase, dependencies, or build configuration has been established yet.

## Getting Started

When initializing this project, consider:
- The project name "notifier" suggests a notification system
- Determine the appropriate technology stack based on user requirements
- Set up the project structure according to the chosen framework/language conventions

## Next Steps

When the user provides requirements, help them:
1. Choose an appropriate technology stack
2. Initialize the project with proper package management
3. Set up the basic project structure
4. Configure linting, testing, and build tools as needed
